3,1.        General Considerations
4,This Excel workbook contains all Monthly module data reported to the NTD since January 2002 when the Monthly module was introduced in the National Transit Database (NTD).
5,"Beginning with Calendar Year 2012, the bottom of each monthly data worksheet (UPT, VRM, VRH, VOMS) presents estimated monthly industry totals for Reduced Reporters (agencies operating fewer than 30 vehicles in maximum service). These agencies do not report data to the Monthly Ridership module effective in 2012. Estimates are calculated by dividing the annual service data values reported on the Reduced Reporting (RR-20) forms for the previous Annual Report year by 12. Estimated VOMS is presented as the actual VOMS reported on the most recent annual RR-20 form. Any values entered by agencies with Reduced Reporting Waivers during CY 2012 are removed to prevent double-counting values. "
6,"Beginning with Calendar Year 2012, the bottom of each monthly data worksheet presents  estimated monthly industry totals for Rural reporters.  These agencies do not report data to the Monthly Ridership module, so the workbook provides estimates beginning in January 2007, the earliest public data file. These estimates are calculated by dividing the sum of service data values reported in the annual Rural Subrecipient Service files by 12. Note that Intercity Bus unlinked passenger trips and vehicle revenue miles are excluded from this calculation. VOMS were estimated for 2007-2013 using the NTD's annual Revenue Vehicle Inventory database file and for 2014-Present using NTD's annual Service database file. "
7,"The Monthly module includes a limited set of key indicators reported by transit properties. Data is reported on a monthly basis, by mode and type of service, for a fiscal year.

The four data items included are:

1.        Unlinked Passenger Trips 
2.        Vehicle Revenue Miles
3.        Vehicle Revenue Hours
4.        Vehicles Operated in Maximum Service (Peak Vehicles)
"
8,Users are encouraged to use the glossary of transit terms located at https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/national-transit-database-ntd-glossary or the reporting manuals located at https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/manuals for more detailed information. 
9,"Monthly data are reported by mode and type of service. From 2002 through 2011, there were 16 modes in the NTD.  Beginning in January 2012, NTD monthly ridership data is reported according to revised modal classifications.  Service previously reported as bus (MB) now may be reported as MB, Commuter Bus (CB), or Bus Rapid Transit (RB). Additionally, service previously categorized as Light Rail (LR) now may be reported as LR or Streetcar (SR). Also, beginning in January 2012, the Automated Guideway (AG) and Monorail (MO) modes are now combined to a single Monorail/Automated Guideway (MG) mode. Finally, NTD included a new Hybrid Rail (YR) mode beginning in January 2012.  This mode includes several systems previously categorized as Commuter Rail (CR) or Light Rail (LR).  All NTD Monthly data is reported as one of two types of service: Directly Operated (DO) and Purchased Transportation (PT). Directly Operated service is provided directly by a transit property. Purchased Transportation is service contracted from a third party, typically a private operator."
10,
11,"Effective October 2020 (for Report Year 2020), FTA modified the NTD reporting system  to further stratify public transportation by the Type of Service (TOS) provided. This adds two new types of service in addition to the existing DO and PT. Specifically:

FTA requires agencies contracting for public transportation with Transportation Network Companies report the service if it meets the definition of public transportation, and a new type of service, Transportation Network Company (abbreviated as TN in this file), has been added for that purpose. 

Agencies which are contracting with taxicab operators using the taxi operator’s non-dedicated vehicles must now report those services as Demand Response mode with Taxi (abbreviated as TX) type of service. Modes that were previously reported as Demand Response Taxi mode with Purchased Transportation type of service (DT/PT) will now be cast as Demand Response mode DR/TX) in this series."
12,"This file will be updated periodically by FTA to include data for subsequent months, and to incorporate revisions to prior months in the calendar year that have been made by the transit properties. In some cases, this may include revisions to data from previous years. "
13,2.        Data Limitations
14,
15,Users should use caution when using the data and the following items should be considered:
16,"·          Data quality and completeness have improved significantly over time. The monthly data collection was introduced as a pilot program in 2002. Over time, most transit properties developed new internal data collection and processing methods to meet the new requirements. These developments, combined with the implementation of more sophisticated validation checks by FTA, have resulted in more complete and accurate data in more recent years. "
17,"·          After the close of a month, transit properties have one month to compile and submit data to the NTD; therefore, there is a 30 days lag from the end of the month to the time the data is submitted. Some data may be missing for the most recent month if a transit agency failed to report data on time. Once the data is submitted, it is subjected to review and analysis for data completeness and reasonableness. Additionally, transit properties may revise their data at any time during their fiscal year reporting cycle until their annual report for that same fiscal year is closed. These changes may be done unilaterally by the transit property, as the transit property collects additional data on its operations, and these changes will be reflected in subsequent release of the monthly data base."
18,"·          FTA requires properties to report a 100 percent count of unlinked passenger trips if the data is available and reliable; however, there are many properties that do not have the technology or the means required to perform a 100 percent count. (This is because the reporting of unlinked passenger trips requires an accurate count of the number of transfers made by passengers.) In other cases, the service is too complex to allow a 100 percent count. In these cases, FTA allows reporting based on sampling. In general, FTA does not know what method properties use to determine unlinked trips on a monthly basis, i.e., if it is based on sampling or a 100 percent count. "
19,"·          Unlike unlinked passenger trips, service supplied data (vehicle revenue miles, vehicle revenue hours, and vehicles operated in maximum service) must be reported based on a 100 percent count. "
20,
21,"·          A transit agency that directly operates some of its motorbus service and contracts out for the rest of its motorbus service will have two separate lines for motorbus service: one for the directly operated component, and another for the purchased transportation component. The same principle holds true for a transit agency that contracts out its service that was previously directly operated. The service will appear on two different lines, depending on whether it was directly operated or purchased transportation. "
22,
23,3.        Major Data Considerations
24,
25,"·          The largest transit property in the U.S., the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA – NTD ID #20008), reports bus and heavy rail unlinked passenger trips based on a sampling method designed to meet a maximum margin of error of 10 percent. Starting in 2005, the authority developed a more reliable and accurate unlinked passenger trips data collection method for heavy rail. This new method revealed that the old method undercounted heavy rail unlinked passenger trips by a significant margin, an average of about 20 percent in each month. This file presents the data as reported, i.e. The period January 2002 – December 2004 includes the data estimated based on the old data collection process, while the period January 2005 to the current month/year presents the data based on the new method. Trend analysis covering timeframes starting before January 2005 may be biased due to the data collection method change. The bias does not affect any data aggregation that does not include NYCTA or modes other than heavy rail."
26,
27,·          In 2007 New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA - NTD ID #20008) began using MetroCard AFC data to gather 100% counts on its bus (MB) service. NYCTA MetroCard AFC data have been reported to NTD beginning in January 2008. Years 2007 and earlier represent surveyor data. NTD analysts have analyzed NYCTA data based on these two collection methods and has determined that no adjustment factor is necessary.  
28,"·          Starting in 2004, a new property began operating in the New York City area. The MTA Bus Company (NTD ID #20188) was created in 2004 to take over the operations of a number of companies that operated under franchises granted by the New York City Department of Transportation. The merging of the companies into the MTA Bus began in January 2005 and was completed in February 2006. The first reported month after the merger was January 2006. The properties merged were:"
29,"           o         Liberty Lines – NTD ID #20117 
           o         Queens Surface Corporation – NTD ID #20136
           o         New York Bus – NTD ID #20040
           o         GTJC – NTD ID #20147
"
30,"·          Starting in January 2008, two properties operating in the San Diego Area (San Diego Trolley - NTD ID #90054, and MTS Contract Services – NTD ID #90185) were merged into the San Diego Transit System – NTD ID #90026. The data for this property will now include light rail (LR) (previously reported by San Diego Trolley), purchased bus and demand response services (previously operated by MTS Contract Services), and bus service provided by San Diego Transit System itself."
31,"·         In 2008, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA - NTD ID #10001) began using a new, more accurate sampling method to report bus unlinked passenger trips. RIPTA first reported UPT based on this new method in June 2008.  The new method revealed that the agency had been over-reporting bus trips by approximately 10%. The adjusted data set includes bus trips using this new process for the first five months of 2008.  The adjusted data set also includes a 10% reduction in RIPTA bus UPT for all months prior to 2008 to compensate for previous method's inflated trip numbers."
32,"·         Beginning in January 2008, Hampton Roads Transit (HRT - NTD ID #30083) MB UPT data reflects farebox data.  NTD analysts determined that the previous method (applied for year 2007 and earlier) resulted in inflated UPT levels.  The adjusted data set applies an adjustment factor (0.54) to all months prior to January 2008."
33,"·         In January of 2008, the Staten Island Railroad (NTD ID #20099) began reporting UPT to NTD using an inflation factor to include unpaid passengers. The adjusted data set applies this inflation factor (1.7795) to all months prior to 2008 for consistency."
34,
35,·         In January of 2012 Long Island Bus (NTD ID #20007) began reporting to the MR Module as Nassau Inter County Express (NTD ID #20206)
36,
37,"·         Beginning in December 2011, Greater Richmond Transit Company (NTD ID #30006) MB UPT data reflects the use of APCs (Automatic Passenger Counters).  Analysis determined the earlier method was overstating UPT.  The adjusted data set applies an adjustment factor of (.732) to all months prior to December 2011."
38,"·         Beginning in October 2011, Dallas Area Rapid Transit (NTD ID #60056) LR UPT data reflects the use of APCs (Automatic Passenger Counters).  Analysis determined the earlier method was understating UPT.  The adjusted data set applies an adjustment factor of (1.162) to all months prior to October 2011."
39,
40,4.        UPT and VRM Data Estimation
41,
42,"This dataset includes estimates for missing UPT and VRM data in the two most recent report years. Estimates are calculated based on the monthly modal growth rates from an industry-wide sample of transit agencies. These estimates are incorporated into the UPT, VRM and Calendar Year tabs. Each estimated value is provided on the tab UPT_Estimates and VRM_Estimates."
43,5.        Who Reports?
44,
45,"All transit properties that are recipients of Urbanized Area Formula Grants from the Federal Transit Administration are required to report; however, transit properties that operate 30 or fewer vehicles in peak service are eligible to receive a ""Reduced Reporting Waiver"" that exempts them from the monthly reporting. "
46,A number of other transit properties voluntarily report to the NTD so as to benefit their local Urbanized Area in the annual apportionment of Urbanized Area Formula Grants. Voluntary NTD reporters are required to report data to the Monthly NTD Module as a condition of having their report accepted by the NTD.
47,
48,"Prior to 2015, a number of small transit agencies filed a consolidated report. Data for these small agencies would appear together under a single NTD ID. "
49,
50,"This data set includes all properties that reported have reported to the Monthly Module since January 2002. It includes properties that are no longer active in the database and properties that began reporting after January 2002. Properties may become inactive by going out of business, merging with other properties, consolidating multiple reports into a single report, or deciding to discontinue voluntary reporting. "
