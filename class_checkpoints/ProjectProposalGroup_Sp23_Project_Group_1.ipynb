    "According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, net emissions of greenhouse gasses from human activities increased by 43% from 1990 to 2015 [^EPA]. Additionally, “nearly 60% of the US carbon dioxide emissions are from passenger cars, S.U.V.s, and pickup trucks” [^NYT]. Increased amounts of greenhouse gasses trapped in the atmosphere lead to warming climates around the world and negatively affect generations of people, plants, and animals. Thus, there is a need for methods to reduce car pollution. While there are methods like reducing the amount of miles driven or driving a less polluting vehicle (ie. electric or hybrid) [^WA], infrastructure development and neighborhood design can encourage citizens to take alternative modes of transportation. \n",
    "To decrease reliance on cars, cities can develop \n",

    "pedestrian infrastructure such as sidewalks, trails, and safe street and crosswalk design\n",
    "A neighborhood designed for safe pedestrian access to grocery stores and other necessary buildings can positively influence overall health ratings, as well as air pollution emissions [^NIH] [^Mayo]. However, even if a city has a high availability of car alternatives, that does not necessarily mean people choose to do so. An NIH study found that there were high walkability and nitric oxide concentrations (vehicle emission markers) near city centers and higher income neighborhoods tended to have lower pollution [^NIH].\n",

    "- Are there any biases/privacy/terms of use issues with the data you propsed?\n",
    "- Are there potential biases in your dataset(s), in terms of who it composes, and how it was collected, that may be problematic in terms of it allowing for equitable analysis? (For example, does your data exclude particular populations, or is it likely to reflect particular human biases in a way that could be a problem?)\n",

    "- Are there any other issues related to your topic area, data, and/or analyses that are potentially problematic in terms of data privacy and equitable impact?\n",
    "- How will you handle issues you identified?\n",
    "\n",
    "There shouldn’t be any privacy/terms of use issues, as the datasets we used are open to the public, and they are all government datasets, meaning people probably consented to their use when they were surveyed. We don’t anticipate any issues that will be problematic to data privacy for the same reasons.\n",
    "There might be possible biases, because we are only including data in America (we plan to use the national datasets), and America is a very car-centric country. However, this is the point, we want to measure it in America specifically because we are car-centric, and we want to see if the car focus of our country creates more pollution, and if providing more alternative options would decrease it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t think there will be biases related to equitable analysis, because government surveys attempt to reach as many people as possible. There could be the event where certain more rural places have less responses to surveys, because they are more out of the way, and maybe more rich/educated people would respond to a survey. In addition to that, maybe more low-income areas would use public transportation if cars are too expensive. \n",
    "We could also compare the data from place to place(e.g. One with more public transport than another), and see if there are noticeable differences. Though this might be an issue as well, since the amount of places with public transportation are far and few between, mostly being in cities located on the Eastern Seaboard, which may make relevant comparisons more difficult (especially with the Western US, which was largely expanded during the post WWII years that emphasized car culture and highway construction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are trying to use national datasets, we can hopefully encompass both high-income and low-income areas, to fix the issue of income bias, and the idea of survey bias should be acknowledged, but we don’t really know how we would include people in data who wouldn’t normally respond to a survey anyway, so this is likely the best option.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also handle options we’ve identified by perhaps finding more data or find other comparable places, perhaps in similar nations like Canada which are very close in culture and construction as well. \n"
