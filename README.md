# Smog vs. Walkability Analysis

This repo analyzed data related to greenhouse gas emissions, public transit ridership, and walkability for all 50 US states. We used this data to help create visualizations related to pollution, miles travelled, population density, and walkability for each state to get an idea of how these factors helped to answer our question of whether less smog pollution results from higher walkability, more public transit and more people taking public transit. We found out that factors like walkability, distance to the location you want to travel, and public transit ridership help to contribute to lower smog pollution overall.

### Research Question
Is increased availability of public transportation and walkability in cities an effective way of reducing smog pollution? In measurable terms, do US states with
1. higher walkability indices
2. more public transportation infrastructure, and
3. high public transportation ridership numbers

have less smog pollution, thus indicating that people choose to use these resources?
